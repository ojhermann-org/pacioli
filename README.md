curated judgment._

Pacioli proposes to split accounting into two cleanly isolated layers:

- **The mechanics** — the deterministic, total parts of accounting, to be
  codified in _Lean 4_ so that illegal states are unrepresentable and the
  invariants that matter are machine-checked.
- **The judgment** — the contextual decisions (policy, jurisdiction, timing,
  materiality, classification), to be curated in the _Open Knowledge Format
  (OKF)_ so that humans and AI agents can share the same auditable reasoning.

The ambition: Lean guarantees that _given_ a set of accounting inputs the
mechanics are handled correctly; OKF guides the judgment about _what_ those
inputs should be.

## Why this split

Most attempts to formalize accounting fail because they try to prove judgment
calls. Revenue-recognition timing, impairment, fair-value estimates, and
GAAP-vs-IFRS classifications are not mathematical theorems — they are shifting
policies. Forcing these fluid rules into a strict type system creates brittle
code that secretly hardcodes compliance policy, and it rots the moment an
accounting standard changes.

So the seam is a single question, asked of every rule:

> **Can this be made total and mechanical?**

That question sorts each kind of accounting work onto one side of the seam:

|              | Yes → the mechanics (Lean)                                                                      | No → the judgment (OKF)                                                                                           |
| ------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Nature       | Total functions, algebraic invariants                                                           | Policy, _"it depends"_, context                                                                                   |
| Examples     | Double-entry balance, aggregation and rollup, period-close arithmetic, consolidation arithmetic | Revenue-recognition timing, depreciation-method choice, impairment triggers, materiality thresholds, GAAP vs IFRS |
| Guarantee    | Machine-checked proof; illegal states uninhabited                                               | Auditable, cited, human- and agent-readable reasoning                                                             |
| Changes when | The _mathematics_ changes (rarely)                                                              | A _standard or policy_ changes (often)                                                                            |

Some statements straddle the seam on purpose. The **accounting equation**
(`assets = liabilities + equity`) is the canonical one: it needs each account
_classified_ as an asset, liability, or equity — that classification is
judgment — and _then_ a mechanical theorem that the classified parts sum
correctly. It is not one side or the other; it is a judgment input plus a
mechanical proof, meeting at the seam.

## The interface contract (the crux)

The two halves are meant to meet at exactly one kind of handshake, and keeping
it clean is the whole design:

> A judgment (an OKF concept) produces **inputs** — plain data — and the Lean
> kernel consumes those inputs **deterministically** and guarantees the
> mechanics. The kernel neither knows nor cares _why_ the inputs are what they
> are.

Illustratively: a policy for how to recognize revenue over a contract is
judgment; from it a recognition _schedule_ is produced — just amounts and
periods; and the kernel's job is to prove the resulting postings satisfy the
mechanical properties it is responsible for (that they balance). The intent is
that this seam be real — a typed, checkable artifact — rather than a human
copying a number from a document into code.

The invariant that protects the seam: **policy never leaks into Lean types.** If
a Lean type could only be constructed by making a policy choice, that choice
belongs in OKF instead.

---

## Design principles

1. **Make illegal states unrepresentable first, prove second.** Use Lean's type
   system so that, e.g., an unbalanced transaction cannot even be _constructed_.
   This buys much of the safety for little proof effort.
2. **Reserve full proofs for load-bearing invariants.** A handful of theorems
   the rest rests on, not one proof per rule.
3. **Policy never leaks into types.** When in doubt, judgment goes to OKF,
   mechanics to Lean.
4. **Determinism at the boundary.** Everything Lean touches is a total function
   of explicit data inputs — no hidden policy, no I/O, no ambiguity.
5. **Rigour over speed.** Small, complete, well-explained increments. A proof
   that is partial is not finished; there are no deadlines.
6. **Everything is citable.** Lean invariants trace to their mathematical
   source; OKF concepts trace to the standard or literature that justifies them.

## Toolchain rationale

**[Lean 4](https://lean-lang.org/)** is the intended home for the mechanics: it
combines real dependent types, a growing and well-supported ecosystem (mathlib,
an active community), a genuine programming language that also proves theorems,
and compilation to a portable binary. The nearest serious alternative for
"verified software" alone is **F\*/Dafny** (SMT-backed refinement types, often
more ergonomic for pure verification), but part of Pacioli's value is being a
_citable formalization adjacent to mathematics_, where Lean's community gravity
and proof culture win.

**OKF** ([Google Cloud, 2026][okf-spec]) is the intended home for the judgment:
a vendor-neutral, git-shippable standard — a directory of markdown files with
YAML frontmatter, one concept per file — already structurally aligned with how
coding agents store curated memory. That alignment means the judgment half is
natively readable by the agents meant to consume it.

## The mechanics, in code

The Lean library is documented module-by-module — with a dependency diagram, the
seam, and the theorem chain — in **[docs/architecture.md](docs/architecture.md)**.

---

## How this is meant to be used

Pacioli is built for **agent–human collaboration**. The intended loop:

- A **human brings an input** — an idea from accounting literature, a new
  standard, a policy question, a worked example.
- An **agent (or human) updates the repository** — deciding whether the input is
  _mechanical_ (a Lean invariant) or _judgment_ (an OKF concept), and making the
  change while keeping the halves and the interface between them clean.
- The **judgment half** then says _what_ the accounting inputs should be and
  _why_; the **mechanical half** guarantees that, given those inputs, the
  mechanics are correct — by construction and by proof.

The human supplies intent and judgment; the agent translates it into verified
mechanics and curated knowledge.

## Status & license

This repository has moved from charter into its first mechanics: the thesis
above is settled, and the mechanics are built from the ground up as small,
deliberately worked increments — the entry/transaction substrate and the
