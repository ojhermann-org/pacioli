# Merge an owner-authored PR from the CLI as a ruleset bypass actor.
#
# `gh pr merge` can't do this: --admin overrides *classic* branch protection,
# not rulesets, and doesn't circumvent the merge queue; worse, `gh pr merge`
# refuses at pre-flight when you *have* ruleset bypass authority (cli/cli #8746,
# #13388). The raw REST merge endpoint DOES engage your bypass correctly — even
# with the merge queue + required review — so this script wraps that, then
# deletes the head branch and fast-forwards local main.
#
# It bypasses the required owner review, so it is for merging owner-authored PRs
# (which can't be self-approved). External contributions go through the normal
# gate (owner review -> queue). The auto-mode classifier blocks an *unsolicited*
# agent self-merge, exactly as it blocks --admin — but the agent MAY run this
# when the owner explicitly asks it to merge a specific PR (standing grant in
# ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md, Pull-requests -> the pacioli carve-out).
#
# By default it refuses unless the PR's required checks are all green; pass
# --force to override (e.g. a docs-only emergency). Bypassing CI is the one
# thing this repo cares most about NOT doing casually.
#
# Usage: scripts/merge.sh <pr-number> [--force]
#
# Requires: gh (authenticated, with bypass authority), jq, git.
